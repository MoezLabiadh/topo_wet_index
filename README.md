# topo_wet_index
This script calculates the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
of a given Area of Interest.

TWI is used to evaluate the effect of Topography on Hydrological Processes.
The index is intended to help Road Engineers better plan and construct roads
by providing information on potential water runoff and accumulation.

The final output is a continious raster with unitless values ranging from 0 to 30
(negative values are possible yet rare!).
High values indicate High Potential of runoff and accumulation and vice versa.
